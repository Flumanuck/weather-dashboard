# Weather Dashboar
This website allows the user to learn the weather by inputting a city

## Usage
- Input any city name into the input form. Make sure it's spelled correctly.
- Check the console log by right clicking and pressing "inpect" to see data relating to that city. (this issue will be worked out later and you will be able to see the info on the main html page)
